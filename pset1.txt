      <h1>Jared Mitchell</h1> <hr / >
      <p>I decided to take this course this summer because I wanted to learn more 
            about Web Programming. I don't have any experience with web programming
            and I have taken a few CS classes at Tufts so far. I'm looking forward
            to expanding my knowledge and skill in the world of programming.</p> <br />
